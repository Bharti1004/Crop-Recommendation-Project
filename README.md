# 🌾Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning
A machine learning-powered application that suggests the most suitable crops based on real-time environmental and soil data — designed to empower farmers and agri-professionals in making smart, data-driven decisions.

## 🚀 What It Does
Using environmental and soil parameters, this system recommends optimal crops to grow in a specific region. It considers: <br>
<br>
	•	🌱 Soil nutrients (N, P, K) <br>
	•	🌡 Temperature <br>
	•	💧 Humidity <br>
	•	🌦 Rainfall <br>
 	• 	🧪 pH level <br>

## 🧠 Tech Stack
	•	Python – Core logic & ML models
	•	Flask – Web framework
	•	Scikit-learn – ML algorithms
	•	Pandas & NumPy – Data preprocessing & numerical ops
	•	HTML/CSS + JavaScript – Frontend

## ⚙ Features
	•	📥 Accepts real-time input from users (soil & climate parameters)
  	•	🧹 Smart preprocessing (scaling, encoding, missing value handling)
	•	🧪 Predictive modeling (Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, etc.)
	•	📊 Accurate crop recommendations based on trained ML models
	•	🖥 Clean and responsive web UI

## 🛠 Setup
### Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Bharti1004/Crop-Recommendation-Project.git
<br>
cd Crop-Recommendation-Project

### Run the app
python app.py 

## 📈 Future Scope
	•	📡 Integration with real-time weather APIs
	•	📉 Market price + profitability insights
	•	📱 Mobile app version for farmers
	•	🧠 Continuous learning via user feedback
